# Title:
Information-Retrieval-with-tf-idf-and-BM25-ranking-algorithm
This project focuses on implementing document retrieval system using tf-idf and BM25 ranking algorithm

## Description:
In this project, the task is to develop and evaluate a two-stage information retrieval model that given a query returns the n most relevant documents and then ranks the sentences within
the documents. In the beginning, a baseline document retriever with tf-idf features is implemented. Afterwards to improve the baseline retrieval system,  the document retriever with an advanced approach like BM25 is used.

## Dataset used:
TREC(Text REtrieval Conference)

## How to run the project:
* Libraries required: BeautifulSoup or xml, NLTK.
* There are two python files: tf-idf.py, bm25.py.
* Open the file using your favourite python framkework.
* Keep the trec_documents, patterns and test_questions in the same folder along with the python files.
* Prefereably start with the tf_idf.py file as this is the baseline.
* With eventual complexities: Open BM25.py  file for improved result.
* Each file contains detailed clear description of the functionalities.
